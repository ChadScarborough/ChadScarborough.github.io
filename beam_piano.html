          The BEAM Piano Project is an <i>avant-garde</i> art installation by
          the Eugene Difficult Music Ensemble for BEAM 2022, hosted by ArtCity
          in Eugene, Oregon. For this project, we modified an upright piano to
          control individually addressable LEDs on the front and back sides by
          simply playing it as normal. I was responsible for the engineering of
          this project, including both software and electronics.
          <br />
          <br />
          How it works:
          <br />
          <br />
          When the performer depresses one of the keys, two wires located
          beneath the key make contact. These wires are soldered at the other
          end to a circuitboard taken from one of several video game controllers
          such that the contact between the wires simulates a button press on
          the controller. All of the controllers are connected to a Raspberry Pi
          with hand-written drivers processing the inputs. Those inputs are then
          fed into a Python script that controls the lights based on which
          inputs it receives.
          <br />
          The lights on the front side of the piano generate a ripple effect
          emanating from the location of the key that was pressed. On the back,
          a random set of lights are toggled on or off each time a new key is
          pressed.
          <br><br>
          Below you can see a short sample video from BEAM 2022 where the piano was displayed.
