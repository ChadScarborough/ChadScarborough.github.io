            An API written with Node.js that simulates a prescribed number of games of Monopoly with a prescribed number of opponents playing a prescribed number of turns per game. The results are then processed into a JSON describing the average profits of each property, property group, utility, and railroad at all possible levels of development.
            <br><br>
            Results are displayed first showing the number of times opponents ended their turn on each particular space on the Monopoly board, followed by the same information collected into each property group, railroads, utilities, community chest, chance, and "other". The following sections display the average profit margin of each property and property group with various levels of development (for railroads, this section factors in owning one, two, three, or four railroads, and for utilities factors in owning one or both).
            <br><br>
